# Predicting-the-Student-Performance-by-analysing-the-study-hours
Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours

## Simple Linear Regression
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Let's start the task and predict the score of a student if he studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

## Libraries used:
1. pandas 
2.  numpy 
3. matplotlib.pyplot 
4. seaborn
5. %matplotlib inline

## Steps Involved: 
1.	Importing Libraries
2.	Exploring Data
3.	Checking for Null Values
4.	Data Visualisation
5.	Split data into Train and Test
6.	Build Linear Regression Model
7.	Testing the Model
8.	Checking the Accuracy
9.	Summary

## Summary:
We have successfully build the Regression Algorithm with an accuracy of 94.5% and we can say that if the students study for 9.5 Hrs per day they can score around 94 Marks (Rounded up from 93.69%)
